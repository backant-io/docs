BackAnt is a CLI tool and MCP server that generates complete, layered Flask API projects from a single command or a JSON spec. Every generated project follows a strict four-layer architecture (Routes → Services → Repositories → Models) so your codebase stays clean from day one.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scaffold a project">
    Run `ant generate api my-api` to create a full Flask project with Docker, PostgreSQL, and a working default route.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define your API with a spec">
    Write a JSON spec describing your routes and subroutes, then pass it with `--json`. BackAnt generates every layer automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add routes incrementally">
    Use `ant generate route` and `ant generate subroute` to extend your project at any time from the project root.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run with Docker Compose">
    `docker-compose up --build` — your API is live on `localhost:5000`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Routes** | Flask Blueprints that handle HTTP — call services and return JSON |
| **Services** | Business logic layer — validation, calculations, orchestration |
| **Repositories** | Data access layer — all SQLAlchemy queries live here |
| **Models** | SQLAlchemy dataclass definitions for your database tables |
| **MCP Server** | Lets AI agents scaffold and extend your project programmatically |
