    - Automatic setup via wizard
    - Remote server — zero local dependencies
    - Manual config for any agent
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI" icon="square-terminal" href="/cli/installation">
    Install the `ant` CLI to scaffold and extend Flask APIs from your terminal.

    - `pip install backant-cli`
    - Requires Python 3.11+
    - Works standalone or alongside the MCP server
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Not sure which to pick?** If you use an AI coding agent like Cursor or Claude Code, start with the **MCP Server** — your agent can scaffold entire APIs for you. If you prefer the terminal, install the **CLI**.
